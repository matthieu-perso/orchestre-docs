Welcome ! Glad you think Orchestre can be use. Here is a quick overview of the project.

1. Core concepts

Core concepts : 
- Products : Product or information you fetch 
- Providers : Third party apps (eg Gmail or Whatsapp)
- Services : LLM Services 

Orchestre automates providers through services. The automation can retrieve information from Products.

 2. Directory Structure

- apis: Contains the api endpoints declarations (user, bot, message, provider features)
- core: Contains the core classes; bot, dynamic loader, task management, utils classes
- db: Contains the Firebase database access functions
- products: Contains the Product associated classes
- providers: Contains the Provider classes. New provider classes will be added here
- services: Contains the class for LLMs.
- tests : Contains the unit-test classes


The server pools the provider at set intervals (of your choosing) to check if there is any new messages or information. 

Based on the rules you've set in the provider, the server then replies with an auto generated message.
