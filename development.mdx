### Build the Docker Image

1. Navigate to the directory containing the Dockerfile.
2. Build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t Dockerfile .
```


### Run the Docker Container

Once the Docker image is built, you can run a container using:

```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 your_image_name
```

This will start the application, and it will be accessible at `http://localhost:8000`.

### Custom Ports

By default, the application inside the Docker container runs on port 8000. If you want to map this to a different port on your host machine, you can adjust the `-p` flag in the `docker run` command. For instance, to map to port 8080 on your host, use:

```bash
docker run -p 8080:8000 your_image_name
```

The application would then be accessible at `http://localhost:8080`.

### Troubleshooting with Docker

If you encounter issues:

1. Ensure Docker is running on your system.
2. Check the Docker build output for any errors.
3. Ensure you're in the correct directory containing the Dockerfile when running the build command.
