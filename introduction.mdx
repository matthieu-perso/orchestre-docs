description: "Welcome to Orchestre !"

Welcome ! Glad you think Orchestre can be use. 


Orchestre listens for specific events on the third party app, then responds with AI. These response can be customized - Orchestre can query any information (products, data etc...) from databases and generate tailored responses. 

With its extensible architecture, you can easily integrate your own products, manage users, and deploy to production fast.

**Use case** : Let's say you want to automate customer service response for 15 Gmail accounts. Connect the accounts to Orchestre, add your LLM, customize your prompts, and Orchestre automates the responses for you. 


Key Features:
- Connect prebuilt third party extensions (Gmail etc...)
- Easily connect different types of LLMs (OpenAI, LLama, Huggingface etc..) 
- Integrate external information & products in your workflow (Connect your firebase database) 
- User management API. 
- Easy deployment with Docker
- Easily integrate with Langchain and LlamaIndex

Orchestre is built for scale. You can 
- Have multiple users on one server
- Have multiple providers (eg third party apps) in one account.

Imagine - you're able to automate all your company's emails from one orchestre server. Simple to monitor and to manage.  

Contributions are welcome! Also feel free to reach out to me if the project is of interest.
