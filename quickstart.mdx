# ðŸš€ Quickstart 

There are two simple steps 
- Set up the server 
- Set up your integrations 

## Server & LLMs

You have to add your environement variables. Rename the `.env.sample`  file to `.env` and add in the relevant variables. 

- Add a `SESSION_KEY` : Can be anything, but this allows you to keep your account secure. 
- Download your service account and rename to `fireabase-serviceaccount.json` 
- Download your firebase config and rename to ` firebase.json` 
- Add your LLM keys (eg add in your OpenAI api key)


## Services 

For the Gmail service 
- Create a Oauth Credential from your GCP account. More info [here](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2)
- Download the credential file and rename to `oauth2_credentials.json` 

## Run the app locally

Install [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) and run install the requirements with the command below :  

```bash
poetry install
```

- Run uvicorn server

```bash
poetry run uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

- Check Swagger documentation page

You're set ! Have a look at the endpoints at :

```
http://localhost:8000/docs
```

Now that the server is live - setup a user using the signup endpoint & connect your providers and LLMs !
